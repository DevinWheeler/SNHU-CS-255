## DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client who needed a platform to manage driving lessons, exams, and scheduling. The system had to support different user roles like students, instructors, and administrators, each with specific tasks to manage.

## What I Did Well
I did well in understanding the client’s needs and creating a clear system design. My diagrams and class structures did well in representing how different users would interact with the system.

## Revising My Work
If I could revise one part, I would improve the the look and simplicity in some of my diagrams.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I focused on the user’s needs by making sure each system feature addressed a specific requirement, like scheduling and tracking progress. It’s important to design with the user in mind to ensure the system is easy to use and meets their needs.

## Approach to Software Design
I approach software design by breaking down the requirements and creating diagrams to visualize the system. In the future, I’ll continue using diagrams and get feedback from users to make sure the design meets their expectations.
